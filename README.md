# Developed Skills
Through making this project, I have learned a lot about server-side development. I learned how to use node modules and how to import packages with NPM. In addition, I learned about Express and Web Server frameworks. I was able to learn about relational databases such as SQL and nonrelational databases, such as MongoDB, and the pros and cons between them. Finally, I learned how to keep data secure with CORS and CSP.
