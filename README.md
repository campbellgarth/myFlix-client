# MyFlix client side

The client-side of the myFlix app is made with React. The server side portion of my project can be found at my [Github](https://github.com/campbellgarth/myFlix)
## Parcel

Test your project using Parcel: parcel [Path to index.html]. Make sure to use the actual path to “index.html” instead of [Path to index.html] (relative to the current directory you’re inside).
